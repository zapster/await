await

GENERAL INFORMATION
=====

await is a command-line tool to make the execution of several command temporal
dependant. 

USAGE
=====

    await <name> cmd arg0 arg1 ...

await holds execution of `cmd arg0 agr1 ...` until all processes started in the
same group (<name>) are finished.

Example
=======

Consider the following commands on different shell instances (in a temporal
order):

    shell1> await w1 longrun1 arg10 arg11 arg12 ...
    ...
    shell2> await w1 longrun2 arg20 arg21 arg22 ...
    ...
    shell3> await w1 longrun3 arg30 arg31 arg32 ...

The programm `longrun1` will start immediately. After the termination of
`longrun1` the `longrun2` is issued and so on.

KNOWN ISSUES
============
await can not handle certain shell constructs like pipe (|) redirection (<)
and so on directly. To use these constructs call a shell instance and pass
the original command-line as a quoted string e.g.:

    await test bash -c "rm * -rf ; ../configure ; make ; make check"

Note that the commands are executed in a new environment and that some
variables or aliases might not be defined!

INSTALLATION
============
await can be used without installation. See INSTALL for further details.

WARNING
=======
await is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.
